# Unit 2 Notes: Intro to modules; Intro to if-elif-else
#   How to use branching logic in Python.

# A) MODULES are files that contain code you can import to use in your own program.

# The random module contains functions related to generating pseudorandom numbers.
#   Import like this at the top of your program:

# randint() function:
#   Req 2 int arguments & returns random # between those 2 values (inclusive).

# randrange() function:
#   Req 1 int argument & returns random # from a range created from int.

# Challenge: Dice Challenge 1
#   Create 2 die variables.  Simulate rolling each die by generating a
#   random number between 1 and 6 and printing it. Can you use 2 diff methods?

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# B)if statement
#   Block of code executes if condition is true. 

# Challenge: Simple if
#   Generate a random number, 1-100, and print "You generated a 2 digit number!"
#   if the random number generated is greater than 9.

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# C)if - else
#   if block executes if condition is true;
#   else block executes if condition is false.

# Challenge: Coin flip
#   Create a coin flipping simulator to randomly flip a coin to be heads/tails.
#   if heads, print "Heads"; if tails, print "Tails"

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# D)if - elif - else
#   if block executes if condition is true;
#   elif block executes if condition is true;
#   else block executes if condition is false.

# Challenge: Ice Cream Challenge
#   Remember our ice cream algorithm? Recreate your own below, e.g.:
#   get flavor from user.
#   if user wants vanilla, "You get Vanilla"
#   elif user wants chocolate, "You get Chocolate"
#   elif user wants strawberry, "You get Strawberry"
#   else, "Sorry we don't have that flavor. Here's your Pistachio."
