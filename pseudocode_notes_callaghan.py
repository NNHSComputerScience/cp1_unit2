# Pseudocode & Stepwise Refinement Notes
# Matt Callaghan

# Write an algorithm in pseudocode to program a car alarm system:

# FIRST PASS
# Initiate the car alarm when the car is off and the doors are locked
# Sound the car alarm if the car is broken in to
# Turn off the car alarm once the car owner presses teh alarm button

# SECOND PASS
# While the car is turned off and the doors are locked
#   Turn on the car alarm
#   If any of the car windows are broken
#       Sound the alarm until the remote button is pressed
#   Check to see if car is off and doors are locked

# THIRD PASS
# Maybe stay in pseudocode and state variables. Maybe begin to write code if
# logical structure of algorithm is well defined.
