# CHALLENGE: Exclusive Network
'''
With a partner, write a Python program to grant access to an exclusive computer network.
- Get a username and password from the user
- Check to see if the username/password matches any of the exclusive member username/passwords
- Allow guest access if ‘guest’ is the username OR the password
- Print a message including the username if they gained access
- Print message denying access if the login credentials are incorrect

Extension challenges:
- Can you loop the program to allow the user to try entering the password again if they fail?
- Can you make the program only give them 3 opportunities to re-enter their password?
- Can you make the program check their password to be sure it's secure? (check for at least
    8 characters, at least one numeric, and at least one special character (!, $, &) )
- What other features would an exclusive network have?
