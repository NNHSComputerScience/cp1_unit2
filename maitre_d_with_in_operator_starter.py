  Maitre D'
  Demonstrates treating a value as a condition & the 'in' operator

  Values as conditions review
    for numbers: 0 or 0.0 evaluates to False, everything else evaluates to True
    for strings: "" evaluates to False, everything else evaluates to True

  'in' operator
    Searches in a sequence(e.g. a string is a sequence of characters) for a 
      value and returns True if found.
    e.g. the following prints that there's a fun in fundamentals:
    if "fun" in "fundamentals":
        print("There's a 'fun' in fundamentals.")
        
    e.g. the following prints that there's no i in team: 
    if "i" in "team":
        print("There's an 'i' in team.")
    else:
        print("There's no 'i' in team.")  

CHALLENGE: Finish the program to check if the patron is a doctor 
          (check for "Dr." and "Doctor").  If they are, tell them that 
          they may be seated right away.  Doctor's don't have to tip if 
          they don't want to.
